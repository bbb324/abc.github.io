Are you searching for a software engineer with a proven ability to develop high-performance applications and technical innovations? If so, please consider my enclosed resume.

Since 2014, I have started my career as a front-end software engineer for Marlabs Inc., where I have been repeatedly recognized for developing innovative solutions, globally deployed software and systems. I am responsible for full lifecycle development of next-generation software, from initial requirement gathering to design, coding, testing, documentation, and implementation.

Known for excellent programming skills, I have participated in proposals and presentations that have landed multiple projects. I also excel in merging business and user needs into high-quality, cost-effective design solutions while keeping within budgetary constraints.

My technical expertise includes cross-platform proficiency (PC side, mobile side); fluency in javascript and CSS, good at using several libraries (including ReactJS, jQuery, echarts, ant Design); and advanced knowledge of developer applications, tools, methodologies, and best practices.

My skills and experience developing user-friendly solutions on time and on the budget would enable me to earn a great reputation among customers and my colleagues. and hit the ground running. I will follow up with you next week, and you may reach me at (+86) 18148578741 or johnigzie@gmail.com. I look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely,

Jun Xie
